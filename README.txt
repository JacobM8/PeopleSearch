Project: People Search Application
Purpose: Coding challenge for Health Catalyst
Project Information: Thank you for the opportunity to showcase my programming and interview with Health Catalyst. I had a great time working on this challenge. 
It stretched my current programming abilities. Some parts of this challenge I have not yet learned in school, so I had trouble implementing some of the functionality 
including using an ORM framework to talk to the database and using Javascript for the front-end. The program I created does allow you to add and search for people.
